OVERVIEW=>
STT TRANSCRIPTION= it is working fine with text rendering in the chat
LLM RESPONSE= responding to my speech and text is being generated but it is only showing on the log, issues in rendering in the chat
TTS OF LLM= speech being generated is from the llm response and being saved locally

MAJOR ISSUES=>
#No speech rendering in real-time
#AI response is not being rendered on the chat, only being shown in the log
#The getIoInstance function in livekitAudioService.js still has some issues which causes the failure in ai message rendering
#Check latest error log#


IMPORTANT CHANGES THAT NEED CAUTION FOR UPCOMING CHANGES AND PUSHES=>
#in livekitAudioService.js at Line 261 getIoInstance() was changed to getIoInstance which partially fixes the not function error, this is a key change which affected the error so must be kept in mind

ISSUES TACKLED AS OF NOW=>
#stt rendering
#llm response
#livekit functionality
#tts is functioning
